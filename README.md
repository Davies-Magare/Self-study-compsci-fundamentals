# Computer Science Fundamentals Repository

This repository documents my self-directed journey into computer science, focusing on key areas like computation, compilers, and system design. By working through exercises from the following books, I aim to build a solid understanding of these concepts and apply them to real-world challenges.

## I aim to study these areas with the given materials

### Computation
- [ ] **The Little Schemer**
- [ ] **SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)**
- [ ] **Scheme and the Art of Programming**

### Compilers
- [ ] **Crafting Interpreters**

### System Design
- [ ] **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective**

## About
My goal is to develop a deeper understanding of programming and systems, moving beyond web development to areas like functional programming, compilers, and low-level systems design.
