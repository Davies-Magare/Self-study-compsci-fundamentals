This project is an attempt to grasp the fundamentals of computer science. Throughout my life, I have had a strong desire to study comp-sci, but have lacked the formal opportunity within a school or college setting. Nonetheless, a year ago, I enrolled in a web development bootcamp where I gained foundational knowledge in computer science, including languages like C and Python, as well as an introduction to object-oriented programming. This undertaking aims to expand my understanding beyond these basics, focusing on areas such as computation, compilers, and system design.

This repository contains a series of exercises from various books that I have studied from cover to cover. I believe that by doing them I gain a deeper 
understanding of the material, and have a stronger foundation to build upon other concepts.

Below is a list of planned work:

Computation:
- The Little Schemer
- SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)
- SCheme and the Art of Programming

Compilers:
- Crafting Interpreters

System Design:
- Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
