Exercises from the Little-Schemer book by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.
The first few files are very wordy, a result of an attempt to understand the recursion
process.

UPDATE Thursday November 21 2024
I have considered removing the lengthy personal talk included in the files for chapter
2 and chapter 3 but have decided against it because I think they will serve to motivate
me and be a testament of my journey and my growth. 
The new added parts will show my overall growth and better understanding of the scheme
and recursion as a whole.
